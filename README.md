[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Shadark/ClauseWizard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Shadark/ClauseWizard) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ClauseWizard.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ClauseWizard) ![Python 3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)

# ClauseWizard (Continued?)
Python-based JSON parser for files from the Clausewitz engine, used in multiple Paradox Interactive games. You can open the resulting files with any text editor, but since the file size can exceed the allowed limit for some editors,  you can use other software such as [HugeJsonViewer](https://github.com/WelliSolutions/HugeJsonViewer).

Currently supports both savegames and files from:

* **Europa Universalis 4**
* **Crusader Kings 2**
* **Hearts of Iron 4**
* **Stellaris**

## Note
This project was originally developed by Shadark.
But it's maintenance seems to be abandoned.
This is why I forked his project.

---

* Compressed games: **supported**.
* Multiplayer games: **supported**.
* Ironman games: _not supported_ (in development). If the ironman save is not in binary format, it should work with this library.
_(For HoI4 games, you need to change `save_as_binary=yes` option from `yes` to `no` on your `settings.txt` configuration file)._

# Getting started

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ClauseWizard.

```bash
pip install ClauseWizard
```

Binary packages are available for download in the [Release](https://github.com/Shadark/ClauseWizard/releases) page.

_Python version is 3.7, will test other versions._

## Usage

```python
import ClauseWizard

ClauseWizard.cwparse(file) # returns a list of tokens
ClauseWizard.cwformat(tokens) # returns a JSON-formatted string
```

You can also run `Scripts\CWParser` from your Python setup directory.

## Built With
